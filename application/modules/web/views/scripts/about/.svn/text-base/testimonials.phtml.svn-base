<h2 style="text-align: center;">Some SOSbeacon stories*</h2><br/>

76-year-old Betty Smith was returning from the grocery store to her rural Iowa farmhouse just as the 
snowstorm blew in. Living alone she started unloading her groceries herself. Struggling with a heavy 
bag she slipped and fell hard on her hip…about 100 feet from her house. In terrible pain and unable 
to get herself up, she reached into her purse, pulled out her cell phone, activated the SOSBeacon  
“EMERGENCY” button and was in contact with 911 dispatchers.   
Because of the severe storm and multiple major accidents on the highway, 911 dispatchers told 
Betty that an ambulance would be delayed at least an hour.<br/>

Simultaneously, a thousand miles away, Betty’s daughter Evelyn received a text and e-mail message from SOSBeacon, 
advising that her mother had called 911.  Evelyn was able to access the SOSBeacon website 
and hear the recorded conversation between her injured mother and 911 dispatchers.  
Unable to help her mother herself, Evelyn called Jim, a neighbor of her mother’s, to ask for his help.  
When Jim answered Evelyn’s call, he was already on his way to help.  
Betty had her SOS Beacon’s  “GOOD SAMARITAN” option activated on her phone and so did Jim, 
so he was notified of the 911 emergency call within his area. 
With the help of the locator map and recorded audio and images taken by Betty's phone, 
he knew exactly where and what help was needed.   Within minutes of her fall, 
Betty was assisted into her home where she was able to stay warm until the ambulance arrived.

15-year-old Simone was meeting her friends at the mall for some back-to-school shopping.  
They were to meet at their usual spot…the bench near the mall entrance. 
She got a call that her friends were running 10 minutes late, so she settled down to wait.  
An older man sat at the opposite end of the bench and started asking her question about her school, 
age, and friends. When he asked her if she wanted to go for ice cream, the followed her parents' instructions.  
She activated SOSBeacon’s “SEND ALERT” option on her cell phone and aimed it towards the man, 
saying “I just sent a video with your picture and voice… and my location to my parents and friends.”   
He walked away quickly.  Simone updated family and friends that she was now OK.</div>

88-year old Bernie and his 86-year-old wife Sharon have been married over 60 years. 
They’ve  been living in our neighborhood  for almost as long.  Sharon has Parkinson's 
disease and extreme difficulty moving herself. She slipped to the floor and Bernie could not 
lift her onto her wheelchair. He pushed SOSBeacon on his phone and was immediately in contact 
with neighbors who had previously volunteered to provide help. Because we live next door and were available, 
we posted a note on Bernie's SOSbeacon alert webpage that we were on our way to help, saving duplicate effort.  
In less than ten minutes Sharon was back in her wheelchair.

It used to embarrass 13-year old Wendy that she had to call her parents when she left home
 to meet up with her friends.   But now Wendy just hits the "Checking in" button on her SOSbeacon
  mobile phone app and her parents get a text message and email showing her location and check-in time.  
  Wendy avoids embarrassment and her parents get peace of mind.  SOSbeacon is Wendy's companion 
  on her road to independence.

As 90-year old Great Grandpa Boris pulled away from his week-end visit with his extended family, 
he promised them all he would let them know when his 100-mile drive home was over and he was safe.  
When he got home he activated SOSBeacon’s “Checking In” feature, to let them all know that he arrived
 at home OK.  With SOSbeacon, Boris can still live independently and reduce the worries of his family.
