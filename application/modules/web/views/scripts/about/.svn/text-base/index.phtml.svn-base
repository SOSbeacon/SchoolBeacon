<br/><strong>Note from Cliff Orloff, founder</strong><br/><br/>

We have the technology to be more secure and better prepared!  For personal emergencies, 
SOSbeacon allows a member to summon his/her full community for help when in serious distress.  
Having witnesses on digital record and hopefully Good Samaritans nearby actually reduces the likelihood of harm.  
There is safety in numbers.  There are many good people who would be willing to help a neighbor in distress.  
As noted by Roger Hixson, Technical Issues Director for the National 911 Call Center Association. 
“The ability [of SOSbeacon] to automatically alert friends and family to a 911 emergency can often be more helpful 
than the services 911 can provide”. <br/><br/>
