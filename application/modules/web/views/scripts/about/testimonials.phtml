<p>76-year-old Betty Smith was returning from the grocery store to her rural Iowa farmhouse just as the snowstorm blew in. Living alone she started unloading her groceries herself. Struggling with a heavy bag she slipped and fell hard on her hip…about 100 feet from her house. In terrible pain and unable to get herself up, she reached into her purse, pulled out her cell phone, activated the SOSBeacon “EMERGENCY” button and was in contact with 911 dispatchers. Because of the severe storm and multiple major accidents on the highway, 911 dispatchers told Betty that an ambulance would be delayed at least an hour.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, a thousand miles away, Betty’s daughter Evelyn received a text and e-mail message from SOSBeacon, advising that her mother had called 911. Evelyn was able to access the SOSBeacon website and hear the recorded conversation between her injured mother and 911 dispatchers. Unable to help her mother herself, Evelyn called Jim, a neighbor of her mother’s, to ask for his help. When Jim answered Evelyn’s call, he was already on his way to help. Betty had her SOS Beacon’s “GOOD SAMARITAN” option activated on her phone and so did Jim, so he was notified of the 911 emergency call within his area. With the help of the locator map and recorded audio and images taken by Betty's phone, he knew exactly where and what help was needed. Within minutes of her fall, Betty was assisted into her home where she was able to stay warm until the ambulance arrived.</p>

<p>88-year old Bernie and his 86-year-old wife Sharon have been married over 60 years. They’ve been living in our neighborhood for almost as long. Sharon has Parkinson's disease and extreme difficulty moving herself. She slipped to the floor and Bernie could not lift her onto her wheelchair. He pushed SOSBeacon on his phone and was immediately in contact with neighbors who had previously volunteered to provide help. Because we live next door and were available, we posted a note on Bernie's SOSbeacon alert webpage that we were on our way to help, saving duplicate effort. In less than ten minutes Sharon was back in her wheelchair.</p>
